This map represents the average severity of wildfires by state by analyzing how many acres are burned per wildfire. 
The data came from https://www.iii.org/table-archive/23284 this site contains data  in excel format that I imported and later converted into a json to work together with the geojson file.
I chose a yellow orange brown color scale  var colors=chroma.scale('YlOrBr').colors(grades.length); because it works well for my data and is supposed to be colorblind friendly.
